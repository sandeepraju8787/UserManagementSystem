Functional requirements:

Implement a simple website for managing users;
Site should contain from 2 screens:
Users list - table / grid view with details about each user;
Create user - a form for creating a new user;
Input fields / data to collect about each user:
First name
Field should accept only alphabetical characters
Max length should be 100 characters
Last name
Field should accept only alphabetical characters
Max length should be 100 characters
E-mail address
Only valid e-mail addresses can be used
Technical requirements:

Use React.js for frontend;
Use Express / NodeJS / NestJS for backend;
Use MongoDB for data persistency;
Solution should be Dockerized and there should be a Docker Compose file for running the solution (which includes Frontend, Backend and dependencies);
Docker containers should be “production optimized”
Solution can be implemented either as single monolith application or 2 separate applications (frontend and backend);
Inputs validation should be on the backend side, but it’s also nice to have some basic validation on frontend.
 

Bonus points for:

Unit tests using Mocha/Jest/React testing Library;
Functional end-to-end test using any automation framework (Selenium, Puppeteer, Cypress);
Typescript for both frontend and backend.
 

UI / UX requirements:

There are no specific requirements for a design / UX of the frontend but it should look sensible. Any popular UI framework like Bootstrap / Material UI is preferred.
 

Deliverables:

Submit a solution either in a Zip file or push in public Git repository.
